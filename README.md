# Website Mockup Generator

The website mockup generator with URL integration allows users to input a URL and generate mockups of the website from various device perspectives. Upon entering the URL, the generator retrieves the website's content and dynamically renders it within device frames such as laptop, tablet, and smartphone screens. Users can preview how their website appears across different devices, facilitating responsive design testing and optimization.
